# Hora del servidor NTP

This project retrieves the current time from an NTP server and displays it on a webpage.

## Description

This project uses PHP to connect to an NTP (Network Time Protocol) server and fetch the current time. The retrieved time is then displayed on a webpage using HTML and CSS.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have PHP installed on your system.
3. Update the `$servidorNTP` variable in the PHP code with the desired NTP server address or hostname.
4. Optionally, modify the time zone in the `date_default_timezone_set` function to match your desired time zone.
5. Run a local server or deploy the project to a web server.

## Usage

1. Access the webpage through a web browser.
2. The page will automatically refresh every second to display the updated time.
3. The displayed time is retrieved from the NTP server specified in the code.
